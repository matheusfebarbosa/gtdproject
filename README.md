# gtdproject

A little exploratory analisys project made on top of GTD (Global Terrorism Database).

The entire project was built using Jupyter Notebooks and Python language. To create the visualizations, graphics and some other things, libraries like matplotlib, numpy and pandas were used.

This project was made as an assignment for the UFMG's DCC030 discipline (Introduction to Data Science : A practical approach).
